## Build Info

Windows 10 Home, Version 10.0.19045 Build 19045

Kotlin Version: 1.8.20, targeting JVM

## Additional Application Details
- App icon is custom as a for fun item not in the specification
- Default image dimensions is to have a width of 300, and to preserve the ratio of the image to calculate the height
- Default window dimensions are 800x600, with minimum usable dimensions of 600x400
- In Tile Mode, transformations are disabled. Images are added left to right, and added on the next row if they don't fit. A scroll bar appears if there are too many rows
- In Cascade mode you can partially, but not fully, drag an image offscreen. This is intended as a way for the user to make the underlying pane a bit bigger. Only applicable to the right and bottom of the table. The spec does not require handling dragging images outside the table so this is what I decided
- Only certain image formats are allowed to be selected from the file explorer, these are the same as the image types in a1 (png, jpg, bmp)
- MVC model uses bindings with InvalidationListeners as seen in class
- Any clicked on image will have a blue outline to visually indicate that it is selected
